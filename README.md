# PlanIt

School project, that I improved in my free time afterwards. It's just a simple calendar.

# Technologies

- Java, JavaFX 1.8
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL

# Instalation

Just clone repository and open it in some IDE (I used IntelliJ IDEA 2020 1.1).
SQL commands to create and alter database are in database folder. Server project
has application.properties where database is configured. First build and run server
project and then client project.
